# The Orange Template

The Orange Template, or TOT in short, is a small game template that act as a starting point for all the game for The Vital Big Orange Cat Studio.
The rationale is to reduce overhead of setting up a new game project and enact a convention that is universal throughout the game projects made by The Vital Big Orange Cat Studio.
Thus, this template is more of a standard for all the game project of The Vital Big Orange Cat Studio.

## Project Setup

To setup project using this template, just use Github's "use this template" button.
Rename the current `README.md` to `TOT.md` and create your own `README.md`.
Such procedure is to allow git to recognise the `README.md` content from this template is moved to `TOT.md` and not to be intefered with the new counterpart.
